# NsiWindowsInstallerExamples

In this repository you will find some cool and easy to understand NSI script templates with which you can install for example Windows Programs with an additional uninstaller, License that needs to be accepted, use Multilanguage, add a different components chooser and more - all without needing to program any of this, just using one simple NSI script file.

## How to create the `installer.exe`?

1. First you need to download the newest version of the **N**ullsoft **S**criptable **I**nstall **S**ystem program/compiler
   * You find it here: [http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download)
2. Start NSIS
3. Click under the section **Compiler** the entry **Compile NSI scripts**
4. On the new window click **File** in the menu bar and click **Load Script**
5. Select your written script and click **Open**
6. The `installer.exe` (or however you named it) will instantly (after 2-15 seconds) be compiled and ready
7. Over the button **Test Installer** you can even instantly test it


## What are all these scripts in this repository

*(or not because of the repository is in the making)*

The NSI script examples (`.nsi`) are personally tried scripts which you can change however you want (MIT license).

I planned to include a:

* quick and dirty normal UI example
* quick and dirty Modern UI example
* *professional* Modern UI example with Multilanguage

*(nothing is final, I just aim at these for now)*

## Further examples, Documentation?

I am not the maker of this thing and just read some websites an *learned* it.
